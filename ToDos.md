To Do's

1 - Fix the multiple pin selection issue
2 - Chris: 0-255 , 0-100 and 1000-2000us servo options.
3 - Chris: "For flappers you'll need 4 servos (one per flap + rudder + tail) " 4th servo option?
4 - Miguel: "Just hard code ON, STR, CIR, OLA, DT and PK and give the user the the possibility to create and name new lines that suits him/her better. E.G., I call it cruise, but some other call it "ballistic".
5 - "-1" for disabling the servo pin option. "Not Connected" in the option box
6 - Chris: Other Timers to FT JSON converter web page.
8 - Javier: "Also all program lines names should be editable by the flyer."
9 - Julian: "Does the interface allow for interval time settings as well as absolute settings from zero? (Not a deal braker at all just a nice to have)"
